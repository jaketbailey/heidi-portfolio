                        <p class="content">
                            I am an outgoing, approachable, enthusiastic, self-motivated graduate and employee, who has just graduated with BA(Hons) in 
                            Journalism at the University of Sheffield. In addition to my studies, I have gained extensive experience using Adobe Premiere 
                            Pro in filming, video/audio editing throughout my Btec in creative Media and my Journalism degree. In addition, I have advanced 
                            creative skills throughout a variety of projects I have taken part in including writing and planning feature articles and news 
                            articles for a magazine brand.<br><br>

                            I invest my spare time in my local community through my volunteering work at Burnt Tree Croft Care Home by supporting the vulnerable. 
                            During Covid-19 I have maintained support through regular communication with elderly residents via video, phone and letters. Christmas 
                            2020 I volunteered as a ‘Christmas caller’ at Ignite Imaginations phoning the isolated elderly on Christmas Day.<br><br>

                            My time management strength has allowed me to manage my studies, volunteering and my role as an office and marketing assistant. I am very 
                            versatile and adaptable to situations and manage problem-solving with ease.<br><br>

                            As a committed individual, I have always taken pride in my 100% dedication to everything I do. An example of this is my membership of Sheffield 
                            Swing Dance Society. I am involved with a diverse age and range of people, allowing me to build upon my existing experience working, interacting, 
                            and communicating effectively as part of a team.<br><br>

                            Before Covid-19 in ‘open mic’ performances, I regular participated as a solo singer and poetry performer, utilising and developing my presentational
                            skills in front of a live audience.<br>
